    "content" :  "This project was inspired after completing the HackMIT 2016 Admissions Puzzle, which is a series of coding, AI, and exploitation challenges, gradually rising in difficulty, developed by the HackMIT team. After solving a nice xkcd riddle, performing NoSQL injection and breaking a hash, and reading Backus-Naur form to code in an entirely new language, the final challenge was to predict the value of a random number generator. Luckily they chose an insecure pseudorandom number generator - Xorshift128+ (incidentally also used by Javascript's .random()), and after dealing with Mantissa's and more, we coded an SMT solver to find the initial seed and predict the next random number. After seeing the insecurity of this pseudo RNG, we decided to make our final paper in my computer security class (Fall 2016) about modern PRNG's and their cryptographic security. A year later I expanded on this work, and presented this survey of cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators with proofs at the senior conference poster presentation.",
