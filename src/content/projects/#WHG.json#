    "content" :  "My partner and I use Approximate Q-Learning to create an Agent that beats the popular flash game 'The World's Hardest Game'. We modified enemies behavior from UC Berkeley's open source pacman implementation to create levels that resembled the levels of the World's Hardest Game, and then reskinned the sprites. Afterwards we implemented our own version of approximate Q-learning, and trained the agent on it to see how well it could beat our duplicate levels. This was the final project for my Artificial Intelligence class (Spring 2016).",
