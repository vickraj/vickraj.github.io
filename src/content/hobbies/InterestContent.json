	    "content": "Broadly speaking, my research interests are in understanding the generalization of machine learning models under domain shift. This can manifest in several different ways - from specific implementation of new methods, to dataset creation, to understanding interesting empirical phenomena. See the Research section for more details."

	{
	    "content": "I am most excited about research problems that are grounded in application or broader impact, whether it is just a proof of concept or part of a bona-fide system - I find this both the most satisfying kind of problem to solve, since you know it will have some amount of impact, as well as a great way to narrow and scope down large machine learning problems into actionable chunks."

	{
	    "content": "While most of my current work has been in Computer Vision, problems like domain shift or uncertainty estimation span many domains, and I am very interested in seeing how these concepts transform in those spaces. Recently, I have been particularly interested in how these problems manifest in transformers and score-based generative methods such as diffusion models, especially the large language models and the vision-language models."
