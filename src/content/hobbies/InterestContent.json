  "text": "I'm an AI/ML Research Scientist currently at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL) interested in robustness and uncertainty of machine learning models. At JHUAPL, I led several research teams on effort for performing uncertainty estimation, detecting bad labels, label prioritization, and predicting and mitigating domain shift in deep classifiers and object detectors. This work has had a significant impact and successfully transitioned to several sponsor programs."
