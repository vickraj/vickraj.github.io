	{"content": "I'm currently an AI/ML Research Scientist at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL) Tactical Intelligence Systems group. In 2019, I became the Assistant Section Supervisor of our groups Machine Perception section, which broadly covers work related to model development and analysis, with a focus on Computer Vision. At JHUAPL, I led several research teams on effort for performing uncertainty estimation, detecting bad labels, label prioritization, and predicting and mitigating domain shift in deep classifiers and object detectors. This work has had a significant impact and successfully transitioned to several sponsor programs."

I graduated Summa Cum Laude and with Highest Honors in both Math and Computer Science, a distinction offered to only one other student that year."
