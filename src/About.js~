		<h3 align = "center"> General </h3>
		<p> I recently graduated from Swarthmore College, this past May with
		    degrees in both Mathematics and Computer Science. </p>

		<p>Recently (about 8 months ago) I have gotten into bouldering as a way of
	    staying fit, and it has quickly grown to be one of my more
	    fun and regular activities. I try to boulder two to three
	    times a week, and currently climb at a V3/V4 level.</p>
		<p> One of my main hobbies is playing video games, in
    particular the game <a href =
    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9hbbA-WP4'> Super Smash
	    Bros. Melee </a>. I play this game competitively, and am
	    currently ranked 5th in the Greater Philadelphia Region
	    (Philadelphia, Delaware, South Jersey). Outside of Melee,
	    I enjoy playing Dota 2 as well as interesting indie games
	    (like To The Moon). </p>
