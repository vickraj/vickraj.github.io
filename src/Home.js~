		<p>The content on this website is mostly a series of
    write-ups/code of various projects and ideas that I'm working on,
    or have had significant thoughts about. The idea is that whenever
		I do anything interesting I'll make a small
		essay/paper summarizing my thoughts and publish the
	    relevant material here.
		</p>
		<p>Theoretically, this site will be both incentivize me to
	    pin down some thoughts into clear, readable formats, as
		well as act as a sort of repository of anything
		interesting that I've done.  Most of the larger and more
    interesting ideas will be in the <a href = "/projects"> projects
	    </a> section, while some of the smaller
	    effort write-ups will be scattered around the site,
	    probably with my <a href = "/agenda"> agenda</a> section. </p>

		

                <p>The goal behind doing these projects is to both take a
closer look at a topic that interests me, as well as learn by doing.  
Back when I did competitive math in high
		school, I learned that sometimes the best way to learn something
is often to just practice as much as you can in as many different ways
as you can. There really is no substitute to just grinding experience
with a topic. Several of my projects
	    stem from this vein - by this I mean that if I find a topic that I'm
interested in, say functional programming, I'll try to find some sort
	    of interesting project that lets me both answer some
	    questions as well as get practice and proficiency using
	    these ideas. </p>
		<p> In terms of content, the projects I'm interested
		in usually find themselves broadly in the areas of Mathematics
	    and Computer Science, and can range from small
		applications to independent
		research. My more specific interests can be found <a
	    href = "/about"> here</a>. </p>
