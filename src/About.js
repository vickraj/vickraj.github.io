		<h1> About me </h1>
		<h3 align = "center"> General </h3>
		<p> I am a Swarthmore graduate passionate about using
		    advanced mathematics and computer science to solve
		    challenging problems, both theoretical and
		    practical. 
		  I find a lot of happiness sharing my passion for
		  these subjects with others, and showing people how
		  cool math and computer science can be.
		  I love using computers to make our
		    lives easier, whether that's through programming
		    or just taking advantage of the internet.
		  I graduated in 2018 with Highest Honors
		    and Bachelor of Arts' in both Mathematics and
		    Computer Science. </p>
		<h3 align = "center"> Academic Interests </h3>
		<p>
		  In general, I'm interested in the intersection of
		  pure mathematics with computer science, particularly in
		  areas where new mathematical techniques can be used
		  to improve or create algorithms or understand
		  physical behavior. While I'm
		  interested in applying these techniques to
		  real-world problems, I am a firm believer that one
		  must first have a strong, fundamental grasp of the
		  theory before applying it - in that vein, my
		  current interests are in learning pure mathematics
		  and the theory behind various ideas in computer
		  science. </p>
		<p>
		  More specifically, my interests are in:
		  <br />
		  <ul class = "interests">
		  <li>Machine Learning: Reinforcement learning, Transfer
		  learning, nonlinear dimensionality reduction </li>
		  
		  <li>Algebraic Geometry: Computational
		  Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Curves,
		  applications to Computer Science/Physics </li>
		  
		  <li>
		    Topology: Topological Data Analysis,
		  Morse Theory, Algebraic Topology in general </li>
		  <li>
		  Cryptography: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Pairing Based
		  Cryptography and their usage in Identity/Attribute based Schemes</li>
		  </ul>
		</p>

		<p>Obviously I'm not an expert on any of these things
		yet, and most of these interests are absurdly general
		- as time goes on and I find my niches,
		I expect that I'll be a lot more specific about my
		interests. </p>

		<h3 align = "center"> Hobbies </h3>
		<p>I've recently gotten into bouldering as a way of
	    staying fit, and it has quickly grown to be one of my
	    favorite activities. I try to boulder two to three
	    times a week, and currently climb at a V3/V4 level. </p>
		<p> Outside of bouldering, I enjoy
    playing video games, in particular the game <a href =
    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9hbbA-WP4' target = "_blank"> Super Smash
	    Bros. Melee </a>. I play this game competitively, and am
	    currently ranked 5th in the Greater Philadelphia Region
	    (Philadelphia, Delaware, South Jersey). I'm also a community
    figure in the region, organizing tournaments, moderating groups,
    creating power rankings, and more. I've organized a
    bi-weekly melee tournament in Swarthmore for over a year, garnering
    about 30-50 entrants per event, as well as helped organize
    Philadelphia's largest melee tournament <a href = "https://www.smash.gg/gang"
    target = "_blank">
    The Gang Hosts a Melee Tournament</a>. Outside of Melee,
	    I enjoy playing Dota 2 as well as interesting indie games
    when I find them (my current favorite is <a href =
    "http://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/" target = "_blank"> To the
		    Moon</a>).
		  </p>
		<p>
		  I try to spend at least an hour a day learning new
		  things and improving productivity. Whether that's
		  reading textbooks/articles (I am SEVERELY backlogged here),
		  finding new, cool things to do with <a href =
		  "https://orgmode.org" target = "_blank">Org
		  Mode</a>, building small scripts and tools to
		  use, or working on a project, much of my free time
		  is dominated by these activities.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Finally, my last major hobby is reading - generally
		  in SciFi/Fantasy. I am usually a fan of <a href =
		  "https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/"
		  target = "_blank">hard magic systems</a>, but soft
		  magic done well is also fantastic. My recent
		  favorite books would probably be <a href =
		  "https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen"
		  target = "_blank">The Malazan Book of the
		  Fallen</a>, <a href =
		  "https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/"
		  target = "_blank">Worm</a> (Believe me it gets
		  better!), and <a href =
		  "https://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/"
		  target = "_blank">The Stormlight Archive</a>. I'll
		  be posting some small book reviews/initial thoughts
		  about them as I complete books in my agenda
		  section.
