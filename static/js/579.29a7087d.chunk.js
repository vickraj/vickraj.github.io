The Perception section largely covers work related to model development and analysis, with a focus on Computer Vision. "},{"content":"For the model and data analysis, I have led several research teams on efforts for performing uncertainty estimation, detecting bad labels, label prioritization, and predicting and mitigating domain shift in deep classifiers and object detectors. This work has had a significant impact and successfully transitioned to several sponsor programs. On the model development side, I have led teams to construct real-time, low size weight and power (SWAP), algorithms for image classification, object detection, multi-target tracking, and multi-sensor data fusion that outperformed several industry competitors."},{"content":"Prior to my time at JHUAPL, I studied Math and Computer Science at Swarthmore College, and successfully completed my double major in three years. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and with Highest Honors in both Math and Computer Science (Preparations in Topology, Algebra, Complex Analysis, and Theory of Computation), a distinction offered to only one other student that year."}]}'),a=JSON.parse('{"T":"Research Interests","f":[{"content":"Broadly speaking, my research interests are in understanding the generalization of machine learning models under domain shift. This can manifest in several different ways - from specific implementation of new methods, to dataset creation, to understanding interesting empirical phenomena. See the Research section for more details."},{"content":"I am most excited about research problems that are grounded in application or broader impact, whether it is just a proof of concept or part of a bona-fide system - I find this both the most satisfying kind of problem to solve, since you know it will have some amount of impact, as well as a great way to narrow and scope down large machine learning problems into actionable chunks."},{"content":"While most of my current work has been in Computer Vision, problems like domain shift or uncertainty estimation span many domains, and I am very interested in seeing how these concepts transform in those spaces. Recently, I have been particularly interested in how these problems manifest in transformers and score-based generative methods such as diffusion models, especially the large language models and the vision-language models."}]}'),s=JSON.parse('{"T":"Hobbies","f":[{"content":"Like probably 70% of people in tech now, I like to climb rocks! I\'ve been climbing off and on for about 4 years now, with a pretty large break due to the pandemic. Since mid-2021, however, I have been much more into it. I have mostly spent my time bouldering indoors, but recently have been top-roping and climbing outside much more. One day someone will convince me to do lead climbing, but I don\'t anticipate that happening anytime soon."},{"content":"When I\'m not climbing or lifting, I have a history playing various sorts of games. I\'m a semi-retired, semi-professional Super Smash Bros. Melee player (yes, the gamecube one) under the shocking tag \'Vickram\'. While I really only play casually now, I used to be ranked 5th in the Greater Philadelphia Region, 2nd in Delaware, and have wins on several Top 100 ranked players."},{"content":"I enjoy reading - mostly fiction, but I am not opposed to some good non-fiction books as well. I usually spend at least an hour of every day reading, which could range anywhere from three pages of Do Carmo\'s Riemannian Geometry book to several chapters of the most recent web-fiction that has gathered my interest. My favorite book series are likely the Stormlight Archive, Malazan Book of the Fallen, and Worm."},{"content":"Outside of these main hobbies, some other assorted things I like to keep myself busy with include hiking, volleyball, tennis, music, random machine learning projects, movies, and television."}]}'),r=n(184),l=(0,o.lazy)((function(){return Promise.resolve().then(n.bind(n,2478))})),c=(0,o.lazy)((function(){return n.e(333).then(n.bind(n,3333))})),d=(0,o.lazy)((function(){return Promise.all([n.e(58),n.e(326)]).then(n.bind(n,9510))})),m=function(){return(0,r.jsxs)(l,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(c,{}),(0,r.jsx)(d,{type:"right",title:a.T,content:a.f,icon:"combo_apl.png",id:"About"}),(0,r.jsx)(d,{type:"left",title:i.T,content:i.f,icon:"swat.jpg",id:"Education"}),(0,r.jsx)(d,{type:"right",title:s.T,content:s.f,icon:"library_vancouver.jpg",id:"Hobby"})]})}}}]);
